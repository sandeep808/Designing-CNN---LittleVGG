# Designing-CNN---LittleVGG


LittleVGG :

● LittleVGG is my own downsized version of VGG16

● VGG inspiring networks all use:

○ A series of 3x3 Convolution Layers

○ Convolution to ReLU Blocks where the number of these filters increases the deeper we go.

● Let’s take a look at a visualization of our LittleVGG


The Simpsons Dataset :

● The awesome Simpsons dataset was uploaded to Kaggle ○ https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsonscharacters- dataset/home

● It consists of 20 classes or characters with 200-400 RGB pictures each

● Images were of various sizes, but all had one character being the only character in the image or at least he/she was the main foucs


Approach :

● Our first test run with LittleVGG and we compare it’s results with our previous CNN.
